<!-- Notes about HTML syntax below (HTML uses tags)-->
<!-- You must create a html tag to start working (as seen in lines 4 and 31)-->
<!-- Creating headers with the <h#> tag note: When you increase the number it will decrease the size of the font for that header-->
<!-- The <br> can be thought as a newline character when dealing with the <p> (paragraph tag)-->
