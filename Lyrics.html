            One two three four  <!-- lyrics of the Song Below-->
            Ah, ah-ah-ah
            One two three four

            Ah, ah-ah-ah
            One two three four
            Have I done my best here, or
            Will I be here next year, or
            Are these my best years yet?

            Was looking forward to
            Being important but
            I'm not important yet
            If you put this scene on a movie screen
            Is it called a happy end?

            If the world gets me
            Where I'm supposed to be
            Will I know I've made it then?
            It's so hard

            Can we skip to the good part?
            Ah, ah-ah-ah
            One two three four
            Ah, ah-ah-ah
            One two three four

            If there's a good part then
            I hope it's not far 'cause
            I thought it'd be today (ah, ah, ah, ah)
            I napped on campus and
            I smoked at dances but

            It didn't feel so great
            If you put this scene on a movie screen
            Is it called a happy end?
            If the world gets me
            Where I'm supposed to be
            Will I know I've made it then?
            It's so hard
            So can we skip to the good part?

            Ah, ah-ah-ah
            One two three four
            Ah, ah-ah-ah
            One two three four (can we skip to the good part?)
            Ah, ah-ah-ah (to the good part, to the good part)
            One two three four
            Ah, ah-ah-ah (woo-ooh, woo-ooh)
            One two three four
            Ah, ah-ah-ah
            These things take time
            Mom and dad, they have a good life
            But, what am I gonna do with mine?

            These things take time
            Mom and dad, they have a good life
            But, what the hell am I gonna do with mine?
